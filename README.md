# Similarity Lab

Similarity Lab provides a set of tools and trained embedding matrices for historical language analysis.

With the aid of this toolset you will be able to track changes of words significance across several decades.

## What's inside?

You'll find two sets of word embedding matrices along with their corresponding vocabularies.
These matrices were obtained from two major vocabulary corpuses: [The New York Time](https://www.nytimes.com/) and [The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/uk).

## Use cases

- Track significance changes across the years
- Measure cosine distance between words
- Perform analogy test
- Analyse change tendencies

## Downloading

You can get all the files mentioned above by just cloning the repo. It may take a while beacause of the size of the matrices so be patient

```
 git clone https://github.com/CID-ITBA/similarity-lab.git
```

We have made a python package to interface with the matrices available via pip as well. It's an active project so make sure to check for updates

```
 pip install SimiLab
```

## Contributing

We are seeking to expand our word corpuses collection so any good reference to a new source will be appreciated.
